# TODO
Cartesian model:
Convert initial guess from polar to cartesian
-> Force arrow points in wrong direction, something wrong with conversion

Possibly add bounds to states
Terminal constraints:
- Orbital height (Distance to origin)
- Orbital angular velocity (Convert end state to polar and compare)


# FOR LATER
For aeorydamic model:

Add earth-moon system
Possible tasks:
-- Find best lift-off time to maximize fuel --
two separate dynamics
1. Standing by
- Entire waiting should occur in the first time sample.
  -> Increase N to N+1 if timesteps get weird
- Waits for moon to be at the right place
2. Actual flight
- Other N-1 samples
- Start at earth, fly to the moon, come in proximity of it or orbit it

x(0) = x0
Optimization variables:
- 1   Time tau
  s.t. xdot = 1 -> x(k+1) = x(k) for k=1
- N-1 States x, Controls u
  s.t. xdot = f(x,u) -> x(k+1) = f_k(x(k),u(k)) for k = 2, ..., N-1
-> Multistage problem

Atmospheric model:
- max at sea level
- 1/r^2 function
- wind as noise (for MPC)
